## Inspiration
**"PadForward: Together, We Can End Menstrual Inequity"**

Have you ever found yourself with a stash of menstrual products that suddenly seem unnecessary as your periods come to an end? Instead of discarding them, imagine turning those surplus supplies into a beacon of support for someone in need. This is where PadForward comes into play, inviting you to not just share the menstrual products but also the wisdom and warmth that got you through your own cycles.

Imagine a community where the end of your menstrual journey becomes the beginning of support for another. Every pad you've saved, every tip you've learned, carries the potential to ease someone else's challenges. PadForward isn't just about donating menstrual products; it's about passing on a legacy of care, strength, and shared experiences.

## Why We Started PadForward

In response to the alarming statistics revealing that 64% of respondents in the United States have reported difficulty affording menstrual products, with 21% unable to afford these products every month, it's noteworthy that many individuals who have reached menopause end up discarding their unused menstrual supplies.

## What it does
"PadForward" is a menstrual pad donation platform developed to address the challenge of affordability for many individuals. Our initiative not only promotes Menstrual Equity but also fosters intergenerational dialogue about periods. The platform welcomes donors to contribute unopened pad packages, which are distributed to those in need. Support through funds and volunteering as "Power Pad Girls" is encouraged. Requests for menstrual products can be made through a dedicated form, and feedback is welcome on the contact page.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges was our decision to use Vite for the first time, pushing us to learn a new tool under time constraints. Integrating the Google Maps API presented another hurdle, as we navigated through its documentation to understand error handling. The 24-hour coding marathon tested our abilities to communicate and collaborate effectively under pressure.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of bringing our idea to life, creating a functional platform that addresses a critical social issue. Successfully using new technologies like Vite and integrating external APIs such as Google Maps are significant technical achievements. Most importantly, fostering a sense of community and support through PadForward fills us with pride.

## What we learned
Through this project, we learned the importance of teamwork and effective communication, especially when working under tight deadlines. The technical skills gained from using a new development environment and APIs have been invaluable. Additionally, we deepened our understanding of menstrual equity and the impact of community support on addressing social issues.
